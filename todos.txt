## ORGANIZAR DEPOIS - COMO INSTALAR VMWARE

I realize this is a few months late, but since I spent a day figuring this out, might as well document it somewhere and hopefully help a soul.
Not sure what Linux distro you're using, but let's presume it's a vanilla Debian 10 with Google Chrome for browser, and you're using Workspace ONE to launch your virtual desktop.
Check to see if MIME type vmware-view is defined:
xdg-mime query default x-scheme-handler/vmware-view
You should get something like this:
vmware-view.desktop
If not, then define it like this:
xdg-mime default vmware-view.desktop x-scheme-handler/vmware-view
NOTE: It's likely the association will be created in the ~/.config/mimeapps.list file.
Now make sure the selected handler file (vmware-view.desktop) is available under /usr/share/applications/.
Use the following to run a quick test (Horizon client should launch, albeit with an error).
xdg-open vmware-view:
If desired, the vmware-view.desktop file can be copied to ~/.local/share/applications and modified, for example if launching the client through a SOCKS proxy, although I would recommend renaming it to something else, ex. vmware-view-socks5.desktop, and changing the vmware-view association.
