* Change the light

Function to change the light of the monitors. Today it is the simplest most common form. Later can be upgraded.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(defun change-light ()
(let (
        (light-str (completing-read "Light Number (0-100): " '())))
    (shell-command (concat "avalight.sh -I " light-str))))

* Change the theme

This will be worked with time. For time being it will do the following:
- Change the theme for the day
- Change the fonts of the theme

Later it is on the road map:
- Choose a font map.
- Maybe choose a theme and select the wp and fonts that is cool with the theme.


#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (defun disable-all-themes()
    "Disable all active themes"
    (dolist (theme custom-enabled-themes)
      (disable-theme theme)))


  (defun change-theme()
    "First disable all themes and then chose a theme and font"
    (shell-command "nitrogen --restore")
    (shell-command "start_picom.sh \"emacs\"")
    (ava/update-transparency)
    (disable-all-themes)
    (load-theme (get-theme) t)
    (set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'alpha ava/transparency-level)
    (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist ava/transparency-level-list)
    (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font (get-font) :height ava/default-font-size))
